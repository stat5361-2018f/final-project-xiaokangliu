## Method

Clustered spatial point processes are popular tools to model clustered events 
in spatial point pattern data.
<!-- such as the distribution of one species of trees in a forest. -->
In general, the clustered Poisson process consists of a parent process and a child
process. For example, the Neyman-Scott process consists of a Poisson process
generating events at location $c$ with a constant intensity function $\kappa>0$
(parent process), and a Poisson process $Y_c$ (child process) with inhomogeneous
intensity function $\lambda_c(s;\beta,w)=h(s-c;w)\exp\{x(s)'\beta\}$, where
$h(s-c;w)$ is a density function parameterized by $w$, with
$x(s)=(x_1(s),\ldots,x_p(s))$ representing a $p$-dimensional location related
vector of covariates, and $\beta=(\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_p)$ regression the vector
of coefficients. The superposition of the child processes
$Y=\cup_{c \in C} Y_c$ defined a Neyman-Scott process with intensity
function $\lambda(s;\beta)=\exp\{x(s)'\beta^*\}$, where
$\beta^*=(\log(\kappa)+\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_p)'$. In some studies,
$p$ maybe very large, thus it is of interest to identify important factors
underlying such spatial point patterns. @thurman2015regularized proposed a
regularized method to solve the variable selection problem in clustered spatial
point processes, which minimizes a combination of a goodness-of-fit term, and a
model complexity penalization term. In their paper, instead of using Monte Carlo
methods to approximate the maximum likelihood estimates, estimates were obtained
by solving the estimating equation, formulated by getting the first order
derivative of the log-likelihood function for the Poisson process. This
estimation procedure can greatly improve computation efficiency. Further, for
incorporating the information about the interaction of events, the weighted
quasi-log-likelihood function is used to measure the goodness of fit and leads
to a weighted estimating equation. For the regularization, an adaptive Lasso
penalty is used.
<!-- , which can compel some small coefficients to be exactly zero, -->
<!-- therefore conducting variable selection.  -->


In this project, we will realize the algorithm used to solve this estimation
problem using R. Also, we try to achieve the generalization from modeling one
single clustered Poisson process to simultaneously model several process
in order to take into consideration the potential correlation between
different species. For example, there maybe coexistence or compulsion
effect among different tree species. We want to leverage strength from such kind
of between-species relationship to improve variable selection accuracy.
Toward this goal, some other regularization methods are considered,
like group Lasso penalty to achieve row-sparsity of the coefficient matrix. 


## Application

We are going to apply the multivariate point process to model the distribution
of several species of trees in a forest plot on the Barro Colorado Island (BCI).
In this dataset, the 50-hectare permanent tree plot was established in 1980 in
the tropical moist forest of BCI in Gatun Lake in central Panama. All
free-standing woody stems at least 10 mm diameter at breast
height were identified, tagged, and mapped. Over 350,000 individual trees have
been censused over 35 years. We will fit the model to some selected tree
species, including B. pendula, O. whitei and P. panamense.
The considered location related factors including elevation, slope and 13 soil
characteristics.
